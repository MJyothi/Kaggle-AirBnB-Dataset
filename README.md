# Kaggle-AirBnB-Dataset
Attempted the Kaggle AirBnB challenge using different algorithms like Ridge regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Extra Trees and XGBoost algorithms. Optimized each of the algorithms to compare their performances.   

Implemented Tree based algorithms due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset. Ridge regression algorithm is also implemented to improve prediction by adding penalty component in the regression algorithm
